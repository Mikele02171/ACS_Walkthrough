NOTES:
Currently using Windows not Mac.

-Download Python 3.10 from the Microsoft Store.
-Download Visual Studio Code
In terminal (Using Windows Powershell)
-Run python --version (copy exactly) (if it works)
-Then run python (type in python)
You can run def functions, maths operations and print out strings, ints etc.. 
-If you want to exit
use exit() and Clt L to clear everything in terminal. 

If you haven't installed git into Windows Terminal 

Click on this link to download git to your Windows Terminal 

https://git-scm.com/download/win

Go back into Windows Powershell and type out the following 
-git clone https://github.com/Mikele02171/ACS_Walkthrough 
NOTE: copy where you keep your respository in your github account!


ls
cd ACS_Walkthrough/
ls

Trouble to install Virtual environment into Windows Powershell terminal 
Try
pip install --user virtualenv
python -m virtualenv venv

To activate the Virtual environment 
If you get this error,
venv/Scripts/activate : File C:\Users\mikel\ACS_Walkthrough\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running
scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

+ venv/Scripts/activate

    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

Why? According to Microsoft Tech Support it might be a problem with Execution Policy Settings. To fix it,
you should try executing Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process (as mentioned in the comment section by @wtsiamruk)
in your PowerShell window. This would allow running virtualenv in the current PowerShell session. 

Then type the following again:

venv/Scripts/activate

Should get this, 
(venv) PS C:\Users\mikel\ACS_Walkthrough> 

This means your directory has entered in the virtual environment. 

Type in the following one by one (i.e run it, type it, run it, etc...) in order all of them should work in this order:

pip install django
pip install gunicorn
pip freeze > requirements.txt 
django-admin startproject demo
ls
cd demo
python manage.py startapp mypage

NOTE: mypage is just a title for the app, you can change the title later. 

Run this in terminal:
code .. 

NOTE: At this point you should install Visual Studio Code by now. 

Type in the following one by one (i.e run it, type it, run it, etc...) all of them should work:
python manage.py migrate 
python manage.py runserver

Open the link http://127.0.0.1:8000/ you get your first django website. 

Type in the following one by one (i.e run it, type it, run it, etc...) in order all of them should work in this order:

git add .
git commit -m "<add_a_message_here_explaining_your_commit"
git push origin main

This concludes the demonstration!
